This is the Code of Conduct that we expect all HackBarna participants, sponsors, mentors and judges to abide. This is a customized version of the Code of Conduct used at MLH Member Hackathons, which you can find [here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf). If you have a suggestion for this code of conduct or a question about them, please submit an issue.

## TL;DR

Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated.

## The Code of Conduct

At HackBarna we believe that every participant has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environement.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, HackBarna staff, and anyone else participating in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

## Reporting procedures

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately using one of the following methods. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.
