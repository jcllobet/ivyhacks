We created a web app that suggests several jobs that would be a great fit for you solely based on your picture (you can also enter your skills and interests, but that is less funny).

Basically, you upload a picture on the website and get a description of several jobs that would suit you, with detailed explanations of the reasons why.

You can also select to have a playful tone for the answer, in order to have fun while exploring new career paths!
