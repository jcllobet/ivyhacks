Our project is a copilot PoC to help social education professionals to prepare faster and with more quality activities for children.
Currently a lot of resources are available in different formats (word, pdf, txt, videos) and stored in disconnected repositories (google drive, sharepoint, local,...) and it is time consuming to prepare new activities based on former experiences.
The solution we envisioned is a web app that using RAG pattern stores in a single cloud repo all source references and uses a LLM to provide answers in different languages, pre-configured with custom prompts for different themes suited for education professionals
