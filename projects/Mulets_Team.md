Our project is a copilot PoC to help social education professionals to prepare faster and with more quality activities for children.
Currently a lot of resources in different formats (word, pdf, txt, videos) are stored in disconnected repositories (google drive, sharepoint, local) and it is difficult to prepare new activities based on former experiences.

The solution we envisioned is a web app that using RAG pattern stores in a single cloud repo all source references and uses a LLM to provide answers in different languages, pre-configured with custom prompts for different themes suited for education professionals

### Context

Our project has involved creating a resource repository to support social education professionals working with children and young people at risk of social exclusion.

 We have focused on three key areas for the personal and social development of children: emotional education, sexual education (gender and intersectional perspective), and care (self-care and mutual care).

 ### Challenges

 Currently, there are various websites offering resources in this field, but they lack updates and, most importantly, age-specific focus. In the end, resources end up being shared by word of mouth or because individuals create their own repository on drive.

- Lack of updated and accessible resources.

- Lack of time to search for and prepare effective resources and activities.

 ### How can this tool help?

 This tool can help social education professionals create more effective dynamics and activities, allowing for a more comprehensive and appropriate approach to the different areas of personal and social development of children and young people, according to their age.

 With this repository, professionals will be able to:

- Improve educational quality: have access to up-to-date resources from the sector, categorized by age.

- Reduce the time spent searching for and designing activities.
