Often times, you are looking for where to eat with a group of friends, and one person is a vegan or keto. This makes it difficult to find a restaurant for the group where everyone can eat something that fits their diet. Our solution goes further than just recommending 'vegan' restaurants, it searches the menus which can be pictures, texts, or web pages and sees if there's something there that everyone can eat comfortably.

A friendly assistant also can recommend a place to eat based on more creative needs like 'Something sweet' etc
