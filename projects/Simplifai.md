We had the idea to try and improve web accessibility, especially for older people who frequently have trouble using computers. Our solution makes internet usage much more user-friendly by combining our software with a Chrome extension that is made to function with one another.

Our application eliminates the need for difficult manual interactions by enabling users to surf the web with ease utilising voice commands and audio responses. This function makes sure people may browse the internet without becoming frustrated trying to figure out complex navigation systems.
