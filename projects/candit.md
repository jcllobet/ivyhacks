Let's assume that you are hiring for a position or organise a hackathon :P and get a lot of applications. How do you decide which candidates to pick from your funnel? Checking CVs for keywords? Letting people fill out a form?

Do it with Candit! All you need is your job description or profile to get a ranked list of your candidates using their voice responses to some customised questions. Isn't that amazing?

1. Upload JD to Candit
2. Candit generates open ended questions for your candidates based on JD
3. Candidates responds with voice messages to questions
4. Evaluation of candidates as their response come in
5. Review your list of ranked candidates

This makes it super easy and convenient for candidates and organisations.
