Hermes is a Virtual Assistant that uses generative AI to answer all questions related to the process of migrating to Barcelona and integrating into its diverse multicultural community, cutting through the complex red tape of local bureaucracy. This is done by ingesting and processing all of the data contained in the Ajuntament de Barcelona Migration Services web platform so users always get updated and official information through simple natural language.
